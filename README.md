This repository contains links to personal GitHub repositories from (former) members of the [Hydrology and Environmental Hydraulics Group](https://www.wur.nl/en/research-results/chair-groups/environmental-sciences/hydrology-and-environmental-hydraulics-group.htm) at Wageningen University. 

Collection of tools, software, instruction manuals and other materials for research and education.



## Education
- [A (very) short introduction to R](https://github.com/ClaudiaBrauer/A-very-short-introduction-to-R): The famous 1.5-hour (10 page) introduction to R and other self-study modules.
- [Hydrology basics](https://github.com/ClaudiaBrauer/Hydrology-Basics): Education material (knowledge clips, webapps and more) explaining basic hydrological concepts.


## Software 
- [WALRUS](https://github.com/ClaudiaBrauer/WALRUS): The Wageningen Lowland Runoff Simulator (WALRUS): a lumped rainfall-runoff model for catchments with shallow groundwater.
- [Salt intrusion forecasting model](https://github.com/BasWullems/salt_intrusion_lstm): Machine learning model for predicting salt concentrations in the Rhine-Meuse delta.

## Tools
- [ADCP tools](https://github.com/bartverm/adcptools): Software to process ADCP data
- [Loess filter](https://github.com/bartverm/loess): Matlab mex function to perform a locally weighted robust regression (loess filter)
- [Meander analyses](https://github.com/bartverm/meanderscribe): Matlab scripts to study the multiscale structure of meandering planforms
- [Processing NMEA data](https://github.com/bartverm/nmea-toolbox): Matlab toolbox to process NMEA data

## Code used in publications
