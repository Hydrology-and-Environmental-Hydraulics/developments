# Developments
This repository contains links to personal GitHub repositories from (former) members of the [Hydrology and Environmental Hydraulics Group](https://www.wur.nl/en/research-results/chair-groups/environmental-sciences/hydrology-and-environmental-hydraulics-group.htm) at Wageningen University. 

Collection of tools, software, instruction manuals and other materials for research and education.

## Education
- [A (very) short introduction to R](https://github.com/ClaudiaBrauer/A-very-short-introduction-to-R): A 1.5-hour (10 page) introduction to R and other self-study modules.
- [Hydrology basics](https://github.com/ClaudiaBrauer/Hydrology-Basics): Education material (knowledge clips, webapps and more) explaining basic hydrological concepts.
- [R scripts for hydrological data analysis](https://github.com/soil-water-atmosphere/notebooks/tree/master/R_for_hydrology): Collection of R scripts that can be useful for data analysis.

## Software 
- [WALRUS](https://github.com/ClaudiaBrauer/WALRUS): The Wageningen Lowland Runoff Simulator (WALRUS): a lumped rainfall-runoff model for catchments with shallow groundwater.
- [ADCP tools](https://github.com/bartverm/adcptools): Software to process ADCP data
- [Salt intrusion forecasting model](https://github.com/BasWullems/salt_intrusion_lstm): Machine learning model for predicting salt concentrations in the Rhine-Meuse delta.

## Tools
- [Meander analyses](https://github.com/bartverm/meanderscribe): Matlab scripts to study the multiscale structure of meandering planforms.
- [Loess filter](https://github.com/bartverm/loess): Matlab mex function to perform a locally weighted robust regression (loess filter).
- [Processing NMEA data](https://github.com/bartverm/nmea-toolbox): Matlab toolbox to process NMEA data.
- [Separating and identifying bedform scales](https://github.com/j-zomer/BedformSeparation_Identification): Tool to separate a bathymetric signal representing two or more bedform scales and identify bedforms based on zero-crossing.

## Code used in publications 
- [Spatial and temporal evaluation of radar rainfall nowcasting techniques on 1,533 Events](https://github.com/RubenImhoff/Large_Sample_Nowcasting_Evaluation): Code for [this publication](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2019WR026723) by Imhoff et al., Water Resources Research, 2020.
